# Welcome to my personal Github profile! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ˜„

## About Me

### Pronouns:

He/Him/His and They/Them/Theirs
 
### Interests:

I love making game engines and looking under the hood!  Currently, my attention is more directed towards making discord bots and soon making games in Unity.  My current language fascination lies with Rust; although, the allure of Haskell grows ever stronger with each day.

### Experience:

I have been diving deeper and deeper into the world of programming since the age of six.  Today, I am a proud member of the National Technology Students Association, and a one time first place winner in Coding and second place winner in Video Game Design (COVID interfered with about two years of competitions unfortunately).  I also am learning about the discord API and am currently designing a bot myself!

### Looking for Work:

I'm always up for a challenge, and I am currently open to any work if anyone is interested.

### Contact:

You can contact me either through discord at Ardente#9448 or through my work email (ksbilodeau07@gmail.com).  Please mark any emails as high priority as it will make it easier to sift them out from the other junk in my email (comes from a 8+ year old email haha).
